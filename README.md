Smart Academic Progress Tracker with AI-Powered Insights
Project Overview
The Smart Academic Progress Tracker is a web application designed to assist students in tracking their academic performance, setting and achieving goals, and receiving personalized insights powered by artificial intelligence. The application aims to provide a one-stop platform for students to manage their grades, study habits, and progress toward academic success. It also integrates tools for time management, peer-to-peer tutoring, and motivation boosters, providing a holistic approach to academic improvement. Through AI-driven predictions, the system can anticipate future academic performance and offer actionable recommendations based on a student's current behavior and historical data.

Vision
The vision behind this project is to transform how students track and improve their academic performance. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, this platform empowers students to take control of their educational journey and provides them with personalized insights to enhance their learning experience. The goal is to ensure students not only perform well in their courses but also develop effective study habits, set achievable goals, and stay motivated throughout their academic path.

Features Implemented
1. Hero Section with Image Carousel (Slider)
One of the main features of the homepage is the Hero Section, which includes a 5-slide carousel showcasing key aspects of the platform. This section uses Bootstrap's carousel component to create a visually engaging slider. Each slide contains:

Background images to visually capture the essence of the different features of the platform.
Bold H1 headings and short paragraphs explaining the key benefits or features.
A "Read More" button to direct the user to further details.
Navigation arrows to slide through the slides manually.
Indicators that allow users to jump directly to any slide.
An overlay effect with a black background to ensure the text is readable against the images.
Slide Details:
Welcome to IIT Madras BS Degree - A welcome message tailored for students, with an emphasis on the IIT Madras BS program.
Student Study Group - Highlights the importance of peer communication and how students can collaborate through study groups.
Performance Predictor - Introduces the AI-powered tool that analyzes past data and predicts academic performance.
Good Habit Analysis - Explains how the system helps students identify good study habits and areas for improvement.
Goal Setting & Progress Tracking - Focuses on how students can set goals, track their academic progress, and stay motivated.
2. About Section with Tabs
The About Section is organized into a tabbed interface, which offers information about the platform's company, mission, and vision. The section is designed with a left-side navigation tab system that houses three sections:

Our Company - Details about the company behind the development of the tracker.
Our Mission - Information on the mission and values that guide the development and implementation of the app.
Our Vision - Describes the overarching goals and future aspirations of the platform.
Each tab displays:

A brief heading and paragraph explaining the section.
A "Learn More" button that links to additional details (could be designed for future expansion).
Images on the right side to visually complement each tab's content.
This section provides users with a deeper understanding of the platform’s purpose and vision while maintaining an intuitive and user-friendly layout.

3. Weekly Schedule Section
The Weekly Schedule is a dynamic and interactive feature that provides users with a structured timetable for each day of the week. Using Bootstrap's grid system, the timetable arranges each day in a circular layout, with Sunday at the center, representing a unique study and assignment day. Surrounding Sunday are the other days of the week (Monday to Saturday) arranged in boxes. This section allows for better visualization and planning of students’ academic week.

Key Features of the Weekly Schedule:
Each day is represented as a clickable box. The subjects are displayed from 9 AM to 4 PM, with specific times allocated for each subject and assignment.
Days from Monday to Saturday feature study sessions, while Sunday is reserved for assignments and grading.
Hover effects on each box show a glowing edge, making the timetable interactive and visually appealing.
Subjects like English, Maths, Computational Thinking, and Statistics are organized within each day, with separate boxes for each subject.
The timetable allows students to plan their week, ensuring a balanced study schedule.
4. Resources Section
The Resources Section is designed to provide quick access to study materials and resources for each subject. This section contains four interactive boxes, each representing a subject:

English
Maths
Computational Thinking
Statistics
Each box contains:

A relevant image for each subject.
Hover effects that reveal the images sliding out with glowing borders, making the section both functional and visually striking.
The boxes are color-coded with the VIBGYOR color scheme, adding a dynamic and engaging look to the resources section.
This section enhances the user experience by making study resources more accessible while maintaining an engaging design.

5. AI-Powered Performance Analysis
A standout feature of the platform is the AI-powered performance analysis. This section utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict and analyze a student’s future performance. By clicking the Start Button, the user activates the AI analysis, which displays:

Graphs and charts showing performance trends.
Predictions based on historical data (grades, attendance, study habits).
Personalized suggestions to improve performance, focusing on weak areas and study habits.
This feature serves as an excellent tool for students who want to gain insights into their academic journey and receive actionable recommendations for improvement.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Bootstrap for layout and responsiveness).
AI/ML: For performance analysis and prediction, using machine learning libraries (such as TensorFlow or Scikit-Learn) to generate predictive models based on student data.
Backend: Node.js or similar technology (optional, based on your setup).
Data Integration: The platform can integrate with external data sources (such as IITM portals or manual data entries) to track grades, attendance, and coursework.
